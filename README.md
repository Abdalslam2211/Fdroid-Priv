# F-Droid Privileged Extension installer

![Magisk](http://i.imgur.com/WA4LBkF.png)

This is an unofficial installer of the F-Droid Privileged Extension. With the power of Magisk, this is done systemlessly.

What to know:

* Please make sure you're running at least F-Droid 0.103
* Disable auto app updates from within F-Droid. F-Droid Privileged Extension will automatically update and succeed, and I don't know how this will affect SafetyNet and/or the Magisk Module. (This is because the extension doesn't update like a normal app by placing updates in the data partition, it overwrites the apk in system directly).
